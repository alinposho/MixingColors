 - Since there can be only one matte preferred color per customer the following case cannot happen
     1M 2G
     1G 2M
     1M 2G
 Therefore we cannot have a triangle in this case.

 - However, the following case can happen:
    1M
    1G 2M
       2G
 And in this case we do not have a possible solution to the problem. I will have to think about how to detect this case.
 Maibe remove the first preference from the list of colors when checking whether the second customer should be added to
 the list of visited customers.
